<h3>Repository(Repo):</h3>
<p>The definition of repository is that it is the central location in which all data is stored and managed.</p>

<h3>Git:</h3>
<p>Git is used to track any changes that were done on files and saves the changes that were made.</p>

<h3>GitHub:</h3>
<p>Github is a website that helps developers store and manage their code, and even track and control chnages to the code.</p>

<h3>CLI(command line interface):</h3>
<p>The CLI is a text-based user interface used to run programs, manage computer files and interact with the computer.</p>

<h3>Terminal:</h3>
<p>The terminal is a text input and text output enviorment. It allows us to enter commands that the computer processes.</p>

<h3>GUI(Graphical User Interface):</h3>
<p>The GUI is an interface through which a user interacts with electronic devices through the use of symbols, visual metaphors, and pointing devices.</p>

<h3>IDE:</h3>
<p>An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software application that helps programmers develop software code efficiently.</p>

<h3>VS Code:</h3>
<p>Visual Studio Code is a free coding editor that helps you start coding quickly. Use it to code in any programming language, without switching editors.</p>

<h3>Abstraction:</h3>
<p>Through the process of abstraction, a programmer hides all but the relevant data about an object in order to reduce complexity and increase efficiency.</p>
<h3>Reset Stylesheet</h3>
<p>A reset stylesheet is a collection of CSS rules used to clear the browser's default formatting of HTML elements, removing potential inconsistencies between different browsers.</p>
<h3>User Agent Styles</h3>
<p>User-agent, or browsers, have basic style sheets that give default styles to any document. These style sheets are named user-agent stylesheets. Most browsers use actual stylesheets for this purpose, while others simulate them in code.</p>
<h3>JavaScript</h3>
<p>Javascript is used by programmers across the world to create dynamic and interactive web content like applications and browsers.</p>
<h3>Conditionals</h3.
<p>Conditionals Statements - A way for computers to make decisions based on conditions.</p>
<h3>Operators</h3>
<p>In mathematics and computer programming, an operator is a character that represents a specific mathematical or logical action or process.</p>
<h3>Variable</h3>
<p>In programming, a variable is a value that can change, depending on conditions or on information passed to the program.</p>
<h3>Assignment operator</h3>
<p>The assignment operator allows us to change the value of a modifiable data object (for beginning programmers this typically means a variable).</p>
<h3>String</h3>
<p>Most programming languages have a data type called a string, which is used for data values that are made up of ordered sequences of characters, such as "hello world". A string can contain any sequence of characters, visible or invisible, and characters may be repeated.</p>
<h3>String Literal</h3>
<p>A "string literal" is a sequence of characters from the source character set enclosed in double quotation marks (" "). String literals are used to represent a sequence of characters which, taken together, form a null-terminated string.</p>
<h3>Number Literal</h3>
<p>Literals or constants are the values we write in a conventional form whose value is obvious. In contrast to variables, literals (123, 4.3, "hi") do not change in value. These are also called explicit constants or manifest constants.</p>
<h3>Function</h3>
<p>A function is simply a “chunk” of code that you can use over and over again, rather than writing it out multiple times. Functions enable programmers to break down or decompose a problem into smaller chunks, each of which performs a particular task.</p>
